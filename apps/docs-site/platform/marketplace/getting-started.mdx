## Step-by-Step Template Deployment

### Phase 1: Template Selection (2 minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title='Browse by Category'>
    Start with templates that solve your most pressing daily problem. Don't
    overthink this - you can always add more templates later.
  </Step>

<Step title='Read Success Stories'>
  Focus on templates where other users achieved results you want. Real user
  testimonials are the best predictor of your success.
</Step>

  <Step title='Check Requirements'>
    Ensure you have the necessary accounts and integrations. Most templates work
    with common services like Gmail, Slack, and basic banking.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 2: Template Configuration (5 minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title='Natural Language Setup'>
    Describe what you want in plain English. The system translates your words
    into technical automation parameters automatically. **Example**: *"When my
    portfolio drops 15%, call me and ask if I want to sell some positions"*
  </Step>

<Step title='Connect Your Accounts'>
  Link the services your template needs. All connections use enterprise-grade
  security and you control what data is accessed.
</Step>

  <Step title='Set Your Preferences'>
    Customize timing, thresholds, and notification methods. Start conservative -
    you can always make automations more aggressive later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 3: Testing & Launch (3 minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title='Simulation Mode'>
    Test your automation with fake data to see exactly how it works. This
    catches any configuration issues before going live.
  </Step>

<Step title='Live Deployment'>
  Activate your automation with confidence knowing exactly what will happen and
  when.
</Step>

  <Step title='Monitor & Optimize'>
    Watch your automation work for a few days, then adjust based on results.
    Most users optimize 2-3 times in the first month.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Success Tips from Power Users

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title='Start Small, Think Big' icon='seedling'>
    **Best Practice**: Begin with one simple template that solves an obvious
    problem. Success with your first automation builds confidence for more
    complex deployments. **Power User Tip**: "I started with travel price
    monitoring and saved $300 on my first trip. That success gave me confidence
    to automate my entire investment portfolio." - Lisa Chen
  </Card>

    monitoring + opportunity scanning + travel automation creates a
    comprehensive personal automation system. **Power User Tip**: "My health
    monitoring template detected my father's irregular heartbeat, which led me
    to set up financial automation to ensure his care is always funded." - David
