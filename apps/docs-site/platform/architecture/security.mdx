## Security Framework Overview

<Alert type="warning">
  **Development Status**: Zzyra's security framework is in active development. While basic security measures are in place, many advanced enterprise features described here represent our development roadmap.
</Alert>

Zzyra's planned security framework will implement a defense-in-depth approach, designed to protect sensitive operations across both traditional enterprise systems and blockchain networks. Security considerations are being embedded at every architectural layer.

<Info>
  **Current Security**: Basic authentication via Magic SDK and secure database storage are implemented.
  **Planned Security**: Comprehensive enterprise-grade security layers for protecting private keys, credentials, and business-critical operations.
</Info>

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth (Planned)

<Alert type="info">
  **Development Roadmap**: Multi-layer security architecture planned for enterprise deployment.
</Alert>

Planned security layers to protect against various threat vectors:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title='Perimeter Security' icon='shield'>
    ðŸ“‹ Planned: API gateways, firewalls, and DDoS protection at the network edge
  </Card>
  <Card title='Application Security' icon='code'>
    ðŸš§ In Development: Secure coding practices, input validation, and output encoding
  </Card>
  <Card title='Data Security' icon='database'>

  </Card>
  <Card title='Infrastructure Security' icon='server'>
    ðŸ“‹ Planned: Hardened systems, network segmentation, monitoring
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege (Development Vision)

<Alert type="info">
  **Current Status**: Basic role-based access planned. Advanced least privilege controls in development.
</Alert>

Planned access control approach:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='User Access Control' icon='user-check'>
    Users receive only the permissions necessary for their specific role and
    responsibilities within the organization.
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title='Service Permissions' icon='gear'>
  Each service component has access only to the resources and data required for
  its specific function.
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title='API Limitations' icon='key'>
  API keys and service accounts are scoped to specific operations with
  time-based restrictions where appropriate.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Network Access' icon='network-wired'>
    Network connections are restricted to required endpoints with explicit
    allow-listing and monitoring.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Zero Trust Security Model (Future Implementation)

<Alert type="warning">
  **Development Roadmap**: Zero Trust architecture planned for future enterprise deployment.
</Alert>

Planned zero trust implementation:

- **Continuous Verification**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - All requests will be authenticated and authorized
- **Contextual Access**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Access decisions based on user, device, location, and behavior
- **Micro-Segmentation**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Network traffic isolation and monitoring
- **Behavioral Analysis**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Anomalous behavior triggers additional verification

## Credential Management

<Alert type="info">
  **Current Status**: Basic credential storage via Magic SDK. Advanced credential management system in development.
</Alert>

### Planned Secure Storage Architecture

```typescript
interface CredentialManager {
  storeCredential(userId: string, credential: Credential): Promise<string>;
  retrieveCredential(userId: string, credentialId: string): Promise<Credential>;
  rotateCredential(credentialId: string): Promise<void>;
  revokeCredential(credentialId: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface Credential {
  id: string;
  type: CredentialType;
  encryptedValue: string;
  metadata: CredentialMetadata;
  permissions: Permission[];
  expirationDate?: Date;
}

enum CredentialType {
  PRIVATE_KEY = "private_key",
  API_TOKEN = "api_token",
  DATABASE_PASSWORD = "database_password",
  SERVICE_ACCOUNT = "service_account",
}
```

</Tabs>

### Credential Isolation (Planned)

<Alert type="info">
  **Development Roadmap**: Advanced credential isolation system planned for production deployment.
</Alert>

Planned credential type isolation:

#### Blockchain Private Keys

```typescript
class BlockchainKeyManager {
  private hsmClient: HSMClient;

  async signTransaction(
    keyId: string,
    transaction: Transaction
  ): Promise<SignedTransaction> {
    // Validate transaction before signing
    await this.validateTransaction(transaction);

    // Sign within HSM - private key never exposed
    const signature = await this.hsmClient.sign(keyId, transaction.hash);

    // Log signing operation
    await this.auditLog.record({
      operation: "transaction_sign",
      keyId,
      transactionHash: transaction.hash,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });

    return { ...transaction, signature };
  }
}
```

#### Enterprise API Credentials

```typescript
class EnterpriseCredentialVault {
  async getAPICredential(
    userId: string,
    service: string
  ): Promise<APICredential> {
    // Check user permissions
    await this.verifyAccess(userId, service);

    // Retrieve from encrypted vault
    const encrypted = await this.vault.get(`${userId}:${service}`);

    // Decrypt only for authorized request
    const credential = await this.decrypt(encrypted, userId);

    // Return time-limited credential
    return this.createTemporaryCredential(credential);
  }
}
```

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - In Development

<Alert type="warning">
  **Current Status**: Basic authentication implemented. Advanced RBAC system in development.
</Alert>

### Planned Permission Model

Granular permissions will govern all platform operations:

```typescript
interface Permission {
  resource: string;
  actions: Action[];
  conditions?: Condition[];
}

interface Role {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  inherits?: string[];
}

interface UserRole {
  userId: string;
  roleId: string;
  grantedBy: string;
  grantedAt: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date;
}

// Example role definitions
const ROLES = {
  ADMIN: {
    name: "Platform Administrator",
    permissions: [{ resource: "*", actions: ["*"] }],
  },
  WORKFLOW_MANAGER: {
    name: "Workflow Manager",
    permissions: [
      {
        resource: "workflows",
        actions: ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
      },
      { resource: "executions", actions: ["read", "trigger"] },
    ],
  },
  VIEWER: {
    name: "Read-Only User",
    permissions: [
      { resource: "workflows", actions: ["read"] },
      { resource: "executions", actions: ["read"] },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Dynamic Permission Evaluation

```typescript
class PermissionEngine {
  async hasPermission(
    userId: string,
    resource: string,
    action: string,
    context?: SecurityContext
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    const userRoles = await this.getUserRoles(userId);
    const permissions = await this.aggregatePermissions(userRoles);

    return this.evaluatePermission(permissions, resource, action, context);
  }

  private evaluatePermission(
    permissions: Permission[],
    resource: string,
    action: string,
    context?: SecurityContext
  ): boolean {
    for (const permission of permissions) {
      if (
        this.matchesResource(permission.resource, resource) &&
        this.matchesAction(permission.actions, action) &&
        this.matchesConditions(permission.conditions, context)
      ) {
        return true;
      }
