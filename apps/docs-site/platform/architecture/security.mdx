## Enterprise-Grade Security Foundation

Zzyra's security framework is designed with a defense-in-depth approach, protecting sensitive operations across both traditional enterprise systems and blockchain networks. Security considerations are embedded at every architectural layer, ensuring comprehensive protection for mission-critical automation workflows.

<Warning>
  Security is paramount in hybrid automation. Zzyra implements multiple security
  layers to protect private keys, sensitive credentials, and business-critical
  operations without compromising functionality or user experience.
</Warning>

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

Multiple security layers protect against various threat vectors:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title='Perimeter Security' icon='shield'>
    API gateways, firewalls, and DDoS protection at the network edge
  </Card>
  <Card title='Application Security' icon='code'>
    Secure coding practices, input validation, and output encoding
  </Card>
  <Card title='Data Security' icon='database'>
    Encryption at rest and in transit, secure data handling
  </Card>
  <Card title='Infrastructure Security' icon='server'>
    Hardened systems, network segmentation, monitoring
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege

Every component has minimal necessary access rights:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='User Access Control' icon='user-check'>
    Users receive only the permissions necessary for their specific role and
    responsibilities within the organization.
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title='Service Permissions' icon='gear'>
  Each service component has access only to the resources and data required for
  its specific function.
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title='API Limitations' icon='key'>
  API keys and service accounts are scoped to specific operations with
  time-based restrictions where appropriate.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Network Access' icon='network-wired'>
    Network connections are restricted to required endpoints with explicit
    allow-listing and monitoring.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Zero Trust Security Model

No implicit trust is granted based on network location or previous authentication:

- **Continuous Verification**: All requests are authenticated and authorized
- **Contextual Access**: Access decisions based on user, device, location, and behavior
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Network traffic is isolated and monitored
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Anomalous behavior triggers additional verification

## Credential Management

### Secure Storage Architecture

```typescript
interface CredentialManager {
  storeCredential(userId: string, credential: Credential): Promise<string>;
  retrieveCredential(userId: string, credentialId: string): Promise<Credential>;
  rotateCredential(credentialId: string): Promise<void>;
  revokeCredential(credentialId: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface Credential {
  id: string;
  type: CredentialType;
  encryptedValue: string;
  metadata: CredentialMetadata;
  permissions: Permission[];
  expirationDate?: Date;
}

enum CredentialType {
  PRIVATE_KEY = "private_key",
  API_TOKEN = "api_token",
  DATABASE_PASSWORD = "database_password",
  SERVICE_ACCOUNT = "service_account",
}
```

### Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)

For the highest security requirements:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title='HSM Integration'>
    - **Key Generation**: Cryptographic keys generated within HSM - **Secure
    Operations**: Private key operations never leave HSM - **Tamper
    Resistance**: Hardware-level protection against physical attacks - **FIPS
    140-2 Level 3**: Certified security standard compliance
  </Tab>

{" "}
<Tab title='Key Management'>
  - **Hierarchical Keys**: Master keys protect data encryption keys - **Key
  Rotation**: Automated rotation with zero downtime - **Backup & Recovery**:
  Secure key backup with geographic distribution - **Audit Trails**: Complete
  key usage logging
</Tab>

  <Tab title='Performance'>
    - **High Throughput**: Support for high-volume operations - **Low Latency**:
    Optimized for real-time transaction signing - **Scalability**: Horizontal
    scaling for enterprise workloads - **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with
    redundancy
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Credential Isolation

Different credential types are isolated with specific protections:

#### Blockchain Private Keys

```typescript
class BlockchainKeyManager {
  private hsmClient: HSMClient;

  async signTransaction(
    keyId: string,
    transaction: Transaction
  ): Promise<SignedTransaction> {
    // Validate transaction before signing
    await this.validateTransaction(transaction);

    // Sign within HSM - private key never exposed
    const signature = await this.hsmClient.sign(keyId, transaction.hash);

    // Log signing operation
    await this.auditLog.record({
      operation: "transaction_sign",
      keyId,
      transactionHash: transaction.hash,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });

    return { ...transaction, signature };
  }
}
```

#### Enterprise API Credentials

```typescript
class EnterpriseCredentialVault {
  async getAPICredential(
    userId: string,
    service: string
  ): Promise<APICredential> {
    // Check user permissions
    await this.verifyAccess(userId, service);

    // Retrieve from encrypted vault
    const encrypted = await this.vault.get(`${userId}:${service}`);

    // Decrypt only for authorized request
    const credential = await this.decrypt(encrypted, userId);

    // Return time-limited credential
    return this.createTemporaryCredential(credential);
  }
}
```

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Permission Model

Granular permissions govern all platform operations:

```typescript
interface Permission {
  resource: string;
  actions: Action[];
  conditions?: Condition[];
}

interface Role {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  inherits?: string[];
}

interface UserRole {
  userId: string;
  roleId: string;
  grantedBy: string;
  grantedAt: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date;
}

// Example role definitions
const ROLES = {
  ADMIN: {
    name: "Platform Administrator",
    permissions: [{ resource: "*", actions: ["*"] }],
  },
  WORKFLOW_MANAGER: {
    name: "Workflow Manager",
    permissions: [
      {
        resource: "workflows",
        actions: ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
      },
      { resource: "executions", actions: ["read", "trigger"] },
    ],
  },
  VIEWER: {
    name: "Read-Only User",
    permissions: [
      { resource: "workflows", actions: ["read"] },
      { resource: "executions", actions: ["read"] },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Dynamic Permission Evaluation

```typescript
class PermissionEngine {
  async hasPermission(
    userId: string,
    resource: string,
    action: string,
    context?: SecurityContext
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    const userRoles = await this.getUserRoles(userId);
    const permissions = await this.aggregatePermissions(userRoles);

    return this.evaluatePermission(permissions, resource, action, context);
  }

  private evaluatePermission(
    permissions: Permission[],
    resource: string,
    action: string,
    context?: SecurityContext
  ): boolean {
    for (const permission of permissions) {
      if (
        this.matchesResource(permission.resource, resource) &&
        this.matchesAction(permission.actions, action) &&
        this.matchesConditions(permission.conditions, context)
      ) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
}
```

    // Check against known attack patterns
    if (await this.detectSQLInjection(packet)) {
      events.push(this.createSecurityEvent("sql_injection", "high", packet));
    }

    // Analyze traffic patterns
    if (await this.detectDDoS(packet)) {

    }

    return violations;
  }

  private async applyPolicy(
    policy: DLPPolicy,
    content: string
  ): Promise<DLPViolation[]> {
    // Implementation of policy matching logic
    return this.detectSensitiveData(policy.rules, content);
  }
}
```
