## The Functional Core

<Alert type="warning">
  **Development Status**: Zzyra's modular block system has foundational architecture in place. Many advanced features and block categories described here are planned developments.
</Alert>

At the heart of Zzyra's planned architecture lies an extensible modular block system, designed to encapsulate discrete functionalities into standardized, reusable components. This architecture will enable powerful workflow composition while maintaining simplicity and reliability.

<Info>
  **Current Status**: Basic block execution system implemented
  **Vision**: Each "Block" will represent a specific function with defined inputs, outputs, and validation logic
</Info>

## Block Architecture

### Block Granularity

Every block in Zzyra's system is designed with specific principles:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title='Single Responsibility' icon='target'>
    Each block performs one specific function exceptionally well
  </Card>
  <Card title='Well-Defined Interface' icon='plug'>
    Clear inputs, outputs, and configuration parameters
  </Card>
  <Card title='Validation Logic' icon='check-circle'>
    Built-in error handling and input validation
  </Card>
  <Card title='Composability' icon='puzzle-piece'>
    Designed to work seamlessly with other blocks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example Block Functions

## Block Interface Standardization

<Info>
  **Current Status**: Basic block interface implemented in TypeScript
  **Development Focus**: Expanding interface standardization and validation
</Info>

### Core Interface Definition

Blocks will adhere to common interfaces ensuring consistency and interoperability:

```typescript
interface IBlockHandler {
  execute(inputs: BlockInputs, config: BlockConfig): Promise<BlockOutputs>;
  validate(inputs: BlockInputs, config: BlockConfig): ValidationResult;
  getMetadata(): BlockMetadata;
}

interface IBlockMetadata {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: BlockCategory;
  inputs: InputDefinition[];
  outputs: OutputDefinition[];
  configFields: ConfigField[];
  version: string;
  author: string;
}
```

### Input/Output Specifications

Each block defines precise input and output specifications:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Input Definition">
    ```typescript
    interface InputDefinition {
      name: string;
      type: DataType;
      required: boolean;
      description: string;
      validation?: ValidationRule[];
      defaultValue?: any;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Output Definition">
    ```typescript
    interface OutputDefinition {
      name: string;
      type: DataType;
      description: string;
      optional?: boolean;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Configuration Fields">
    ```typescript
    interface ConfigField {
      name: string;
      type: 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'select' | 'json';
      label: string;
      description: string;
      required: boolean;
      options?: SelectOption[];
      validation?: ValidationRule[];
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Dynamic Block Discovery (Development Focus)

<Alert type="info">
  **Development Status**: Basic block loading implemented. Advanced discovery and plugin system in development.
</Alert>

### Runtime Block Loading

Zzyra's planned architecture will enable dynamic block discovery and loading:

```typescript
class DynamicBlockRegistry {
  private blockHandlers: Map<string, IBlockHandler> = new Map();

  async loadBlock(blockId: string): Promise<IBlockHandler> {
    // Dynamic import and instantiation
    const blockModule = await import(`./blocks/${blockId}`);
    const handler = new blockModule.default();
    this.blockHandlers.set(blockId, handler);
    return handler;
  }

  discoverBlocks(): BlockMetadata[] {
    // Scan available blocks and return metadata
    return this.scanBlockDirectory();
  }
}
```

### Plugin System Architecture

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title='Hot Loading' icon='bolt'>
    Blocks can be added or updated without system restart
  </Card>
  <Card title='Isolation' icon='shield'>
    Blocks execute in isolated environments for security
  </Card>
  <Card title='Versioning' icon='code-branch'>
    Multiple block versions can coexist safely
  </Card>

          options: ["email", "slack", "discord"],
        },
      ],
    };
  }

  async execute(inputs: any, config: any): Promise<any> {
    // Implementation logic
    const gasPrice = await this.getCurrentGasPrice();
    const alertTriggered = gasPrice < inputs.threshold;

    if (alertTriggered) {
      await this.sendAlert(config.alertChannel, gasPrice);

## Block Development Roadmap

### Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1 (Q1-Q2 2025)**: Core block library (HTTP, basic Web3, AI assistance)
- **Phase 2 (Q3-Q4 2025)**: Advanced Web3 blocks, enterprise integrations
- **Phase 3 (2026+)**: Industry-specific blocks, IoT integration, advanced security

<Note>
  **Development Vision**: The modular block system will be the foundation that makes Zzyra infinitely extensible. As we develop new protocols, APIs, and technology integrations, they will be quickly integrated through new blocks without affecting existing functionality.
