## Core AI Capabilities

### 🧠 Natural Language Workflow Generation

Transform your ideas into working automations using natural language:

```
Input: "Buy 100 USDC worth of ETH when price drops below $3000"

AI Output:
├── Price Monitor Block (CoinGecko API)
├── Condition Block (Price < $3000)
├── DEX Swap Block (Uniswap V3)
└── Notification Block (Success/Failure alerts)
```

**Supported Workflow Types:**

- DeFi trading and yield farming strategies
- NFT monitoring and batch operations
- Cross-chain asset management
- Protocol governance automation
- Custom business logic workflows

### 🔧 AI-Generated Custom Blocks

Create specialized automation blocks using AI:

import { Tabs, Tab } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Tabs items={['Input Example', 'Generated Block', 'Implementation']}>
  <Tab>
    **Prompt:** "Create a block that calculates the impermanent loss for a Uniswap V3 position"
    
    **AI Requirements:**
    - Current token prices
    - Initial position amounts  
    - Current position amounts
    - Fee tier and range
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    **Generated Block Features:**
    - Input validation for token addresses
    - Price fetching from multiple sources
    - Mathematical IL calculation
    - Formatted output with percentage
    - Error handling for edge cases
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```javascript
    // AI-generated block code
    async function calculateImpermanentLoss(inputs) {
      const { tokenA, tokenB, initialAmounts, currentAmounts } = inputs;
      
      // Fetch current prices
      const priceData = await fetchTokenPrices([tokenA, tokenB]);
      
      // Calculate IL using standard formula
      const priceRatio = priceData[tokenB] / priceData[tokenA];
      const initialRatio = initialAmounts[tokenB] / initialAmounts[tokenA];
      
      const impermanentLoss = calculateIL(priceRatio, initialRatio);
      
      return {
        impermanentLoss: `${impermanentLoss.toFixed(2)}%`,
        currentValue: calculateCurrentValue(currentAmounts, priceData),
        recommendation: generateRecommendation(impermanentLoss)
      };
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 🎯 Intelligent Workflow Optimization

Our AI continuously improves your automations:

**Performance Analysis**

- Identifies bottlenecks and slow operations
- Suggests more efficient API endpoints
- Optimizes block ordering for better performance

**Cost Optimization**

- Recommends cheaper alternatives for expensive operations
- Batches operations to reduce gas fees
- Suggests optimal timing for blockchain transactions

**Error Prevention**

- Predicts potential failure points
- Adds appropriate error handling
- Suggests fallback strategies

### 🔍 AI-Powered Debugging

When workflows fail, our AI helps you understand why:

```
Execution Error: "Transaction failed with insufficient funds"

AI Analysis:
├── Root Cause: Account balance too low for transaction + gas
├── Suggestions:
│   ├── Add balance check before transaction
│   ├── Implement dynamic gas estimation
│   └── Add fallback funding source
└── Auto-Fix: Generate updated workflow with suggested improvements
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompts

**❌ Vague:** "Make a trading bot"

**✅ Specific:** "Create a DCA strategy that buys $100 of ETH every Monday at 9 AM EST, using Uniswap V3, with 0.5% slippage tolerance, and sends results to Telegram"

### Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Be specific about conditions**

   - Include exact thresholds, percentages, or amounts
   - Specify time zones and scheduling details
   - Define success/failure criteria

2. **Mention integration requirements**

   - Specify protocols (Uniswap, Aave, etc.)
   - Include notification preferences
   - Define data sources

3. **Include safety measures**
   - Set maximum transaction amounts
   - Define stop-loss conditions
   - Specify error handling requirements

### Testing AI-Generated Workflows

Always test AI-generated workflows before production:

```bash
# Test mode - uses smaller amounts and testnet
zyra test-workflow --workflow-id=ai-generated-123 --mode=sandbox

# Review AI reasoning
zyra explain-workflow --workflow-id=ai-generated-123 --show-reasoning

# Validate generated code
zyra validate-blocks --workflow-id=ai-generated-123 --security-check
```

## Limitations and Considerations

### Current Limitations

- **Context Window**: Complex workflows may exceed AI context limits
- **Real-time Data**: AI works with cached data, not real-time prices
- **Market Conditions**: AI doesn't predict black swan events
- **Regulatory Compliance**: AI-generated workflows may need legal review

### Safety Measures

- **Spending Limits**: Set maximum transaction amounts
- **Approval Workflows**: Require human approval for high-value operations
- **Monitoring**: Enable real-time alerts for unexpected behavior
- **Rollback**: Maintain ability to quickly disable AI modifications

## Examples and Use Cases

### DeFi Strategy Generation

```
Prompt: "Create a yield farming strategy that automatically moves funds between AAVE and Compound based on which has higher APR"

Generated Workflow:
1. Fetch APR data from both protocols
2. Compare rates (with 0.5% threshold to avoid frequent switching)
3. Calculate gas costs vs. potential gains
4. Execute migration if profitable
5. Send performance report via email
```

### NFT Portfolio Management

```
Prompt: "Monitor my NFT collection and alert me when any item's floor price drops 20% below my purchase price"

Generated Workflow:
1. Fetch collection data from OpenSea API
2. Compare current floor prices to purchase prices
3. Calculate percentage changes
4. Filter for 20%+ drops
5. Send detailed alert with market analysis
```

### Cross-Chain Arbitrage

```
Prompt: "Find arbitrage opportunities for USDC between Ethereum and Polygon, accounting for bridge fees"

Generated Workflow:
1. Monitor USDC prices on both chains
2. Calculate bridge costs and timing
3. Identify profitable opportunities (>2% profit margin)
4. Execute trades with slippage protection
5. Bridge assets and complete arbitrage
```
