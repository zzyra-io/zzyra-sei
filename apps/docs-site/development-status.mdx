## Technical Debt & Architecture Decisions

### Current Architecture Decisions
- **Monorepo**: Enables shared code and coordinated development
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across frontend and backend
- **Prisma**: Provides type-safe database access and migrations
- **React Flow**: Powers the visual workflow builder
- **NestJS**: Scalable backend framework for APIs and workers

### Known Technical Debt
- API service needs completion and integration
- Message queue system (RabbitMQ) implementation pending
- Database schema needs optimization for scale
- Frontend state management could be improved
- Test coverage needs significant expansion

### Architecture Improvements Planned
- Implement proper microservices communication
- Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Introduce proper caching layers
- Implement robust monitoring and logging
- Add automated testing and CI/CD pipeline

## How to Contribute

### For Developers
1. **Check Current Issues**: See GitHub issues for active development tasks
2. **Development Setup**: Follow the developer quickstart guide
3. **Architecture Review**: Understand the current monorepo structure
4. **Testing**: Help improve test coverage for critical components

### For Users (Beta Testing)
1. **Feedback**: Report bugs and usability issues
2. **Feature Requests**: Suggest improvements and new capabilities
3. **Use Cases**: Share your automation needs and workflows
4. **Documentation**: Help improve documentation accuracy

## Current Limitations

<Alert type="warning">
  **Important**: These are current limitations that will be addressed in upcoming releases
</Alert>

- **API Service**: Not fully functional - some operations go directly to database
- **Real-time Updates**: Limited WebSocket implementation
- **Multi-chain**: Currently focused primarily on Sei Network
- **Enterprise Features**: Team collaboration and advanced analytics are planned
- **Scale**: Not yet optimized for high-volume production usage
- **Security**: Development-grade security; production hardening planned
