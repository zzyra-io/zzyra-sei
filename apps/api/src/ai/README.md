## Integration Guide

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { EnhancedAiService } from './enhanced-ai.service';

// Initialize with all dependencies
const aiService = new EnhancedAiService(
  workflowValidator,
  securityService,
  auditService,
  versioningService
);

// Generate a workflow with full validation and audit
const result = await aiService.generateWorkflow(
  "Create a DeFi arbitrage workflow",
  userId,
  sessionId,
  { detailedMode: true, prefillConfig: true },
  [], // existing nodes
  [], // existing edges
  { 
    ipAddress: '192.168.1.1',
    userAgent: 'Browser',
    workflowId: 'workflow-123',
    createVersion: true
  }
);
```

### Advanced Features

```typescript
// Get comprehensive analytics
const analytics = await aiService.getAnalytics(userId, { 
  start: new Date('2024-01-01'), 
  end: new Date() 
});

// Rollback to previous version
const rollback = await aiService.rollbackWorkflow(
  'workflow-123',
  'version-456',
  userId,
  'Testing rollback functionality'
);

// Get system health
const health = observabilityService.getSystemHealth();

// Record custom metrics
observabilityService.recordMetric('custom_operation', 1, 'count', {
  operation_type: 'workflow_generation',
  user_type: 'premium'
});
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Security Configuration
ALLOWED_DOMAINS=api.openrouter.ai,api.openai.com,localhost

# OpenRouter API
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Application Version (for audit logging)
APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

### Service Dependencies
All services are designed to be dependency-injected through NestJS. Register them in your module:

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [
    WorkflowValidatorService,
    SecurityService,
    AuditService,
    WorkflowVersioningService,
    PromptService,
    ObservabilityService,
    FeedbackService,
