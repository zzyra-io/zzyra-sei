Workflow Integrity
• Cycle detection – ensure no infinite loops before you start.
• Orphans/terminals – every node should either be a valid start or have inbound/outbound links.
Input & Configuration Validation
• Node‐specific checks (e.g. email blocks need to/subject/body).
• Schema conformance – validate your JSON or contract for each block’s inputs/outputs.
Execution Semantics
• Sequential vs parallel – do downstream nodes wait for all upstreams?
• Conditional branches – honor your condition blocks’ true/false semantics.
• Idempotency – can a node run twice safely? Useful on retries.
Error Handling & Retries
• Per‐node retries with exponential back‑off (you’ve got p‑retry).
• Failure modes: fail‐fast vs “best‐effort” continue.
• Transaction boundaries – if one node fails, do you roll back or compensate?
State & Persistence
• Durable execution records – write “running/completed/failed” statuses to your DB.
• Checkpointing – so long‐running workflows can resume if a worker crashes.
Rate‑Limiting & Concurrency
• Per‑user or global concurrency caps.
• Batch sizes and worker concurrency tuning (via BaseWorker).
Observability
• Metrics per node (duration, failure count).
• Structured logs for each node execution.
• Tracing or correlation IDs to stitch multi‑node runs together.
Security & Permissions
• Row‑Level Security on your Supabase tables (workflows, executions).
• Sanitizing any dynamic code (e.g. JavaScript in custom blocks).
Extensibility
• Plug‑in model for new block types (webhook, database, on‑chain).
• Clear engine API so you can swap out implementations or add “preview” runs.
Testing
• Unit‐test your pure engine with mock workflows.
• Integration/E2E test your worker end‑to‑end through RabbitMQ and Supabase.
If you cover each of these areas, you’ll have a robust, scalable workflow processor. Let me know where you’d like to dive in deeper!
