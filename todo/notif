fication System Planning for Zyra
Let's create a comprehensive plan for implementing a robust notification system for Zyra. This will allow users to receive alerts about workflow executions, errors, and other important events through various channels.

1. Notification Channels
   Based on the settings page, I can see you're planning to support multiple notification channels:

Email - Already has a UI toggle in the settings page
Telegram - Input field exists for Telegram handle
Discord - Input field exists for Discord webhook 2. Notification Types
Let's define the types of notifications we'll support:

Workflow Started - When a workflow execution begins
Workflow Completed - When a workflow execution completes successfully
Workflow Failed - When a workflow execution fails
Node Error - When a specific node in a workflow fails
Quota Alert - When a user approaches their monthly execution quota
System Alerts - Important system-wide announcements 3. Architecture Components
Here's what we'll need to build:

3.1. Database Schema
We'll need to create or modify these tables:

notification_preferences - User preferences for each notification type and channel
notification_logs - Record of all sent notifications
notification_templates - Templates for different notification types
3.2. Backend Services
Notification Service - Core service to handle notification routing and delivery
Channel Handlers - Specific handlers for each notification channel (email, Telegram, Discord)
Queue System - To handle notification delivery asynchronously
3.3. Frontend Components
Notification Settings UI - Enhanced version of what's already in the settings page
Notification Center - In-app notification center for viewing past notifications
Real-time Notifications - Using WebSockets for real-time in-app notifications 4. Implementation Plan
Let's break this down into phases:

Phase 1: Database Schema & Basic Backend
Create database migrations for notification tables
Implement basic notification service in the worker
Implement email notification handler (since you already have an EmailBlockHandler)
Phase 2: Additional Channels & UI Enhancements
Implement Telegram and Discord notification handlers
Enhance settings page with more detailed notification preferences
Create notification logs view in the UI
Phase 3: Advanced Features
Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets
Add notification templates management
Add notification batching and throttling
