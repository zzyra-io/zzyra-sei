Here’s a detailed breakdown for each block, including all the info you should gather and consider before building them for Zzyra on Sei:

---

## 1. **Sei Wallet Listener Block**

**Purpose:**  
Triggers workflows when specific wallet activities occur (transfers, swaps, contract interactions).

**Inputs:**

- List of Sei wallet addresses to monitor
- Event types to listen for (transfers, swaps, contract calls, NFT events, etc.)
- Optional: Filters (min amount, specific token, contract address, etc.)
- Polling interval or webhook endpoint (if supported)

**Outputs:**

- Event data (type, tx hash, block number, timestamp, involved addresses, token info, value, etc.)
- Trigger signal for downstream blocks

**Sei Integration:**

- Use Sei’s RPC, REST API, or a third-party indexer (e.g., Sei’s official endpoints or Covalent, if available)
- Must support real-time or near-real-time event detection

**Security:**

- No private key needed (read-only)
- Ensure user cannot overload the system with too many addresses/events

**Error Handling:**

- Handle API downtime, rate limits, and malformed events
- Return clear error/status messages

**User Configuration:**

- UI for entering wallet addresses and selecting event types/filters
- Validation for address format and event type

**Testing:**

- Use Sei testnet for event simulation
- Provide mock events for local testing

**Reusability:**

- Should be able to monitor any wallet and any event type
- Output format should be standard for easy chaining

**Performance:**

- Efficient polling or use of webhooks/WS if available
- Debounce or batch events if high frequency

**Documentation:**

## **How These Blocks Work Together (Example Workflow)**

1. **Sei Wallet Listener Block** detects a large incoming transfer.
2. **Onchain Data Fetch Block** checks the wallet’s new balance.
3. **AI Analysis Block** determines if the transfer is suspicious.
4. If yes, **Notification Block** alerts the user.
5. If a reward is due, **Payment Block** sends tokens.
6. If a badge is earned, **NFT Block** mints and sends an NFT.

---

Here are three real-world use cases that utilize **all five Sei-related blocks** (Wallet Listener, Smart Contract Call, Onchain Data Fetch, Payment, NFT) and also incorporate existing Zzyra blocks (from `blockSchemas.ts`), such as HTTP Request, Notification, Condition, Schedule, and Data Transform. Each use case is designed to be practical and demonstrates how these blocks can be composed in a workflow.

## **Use Case 1: Automated NFT Reward for High-Value Transfers**

**Scenario:**  
A DeFi platform wants to reward users who receive a large transfer (e.g., >10,000 SEI) with a special NFT badge and notify them via email and Telegram.

**Workflow:**

1. **Sei Wallet Listener Block**
   - Monitors user wallets for incoming transfers.
2. **Condition Block**
   - Checks if the transfer amount is greater than 10,000 SEI.
3. **Onchain Data Fetch Block**
   - Fetches the new wallet balance and recent transaction history for context.
4. **NFT Block (Mint)**
   - Mints a “Whale Badge” NFT to the user’s wallet.
5. **Notification Block**
   - Sends an email and Telegram message to the user with the badge details.
6. **Data Transform Block**
   - Formats the notification content with transaction and NFT info.
7. **HTTP Request Block**
   - Optionally, logs the event to an external analytics API.

## **Use Case 2: Automated Payroll with Compliance Check**

**Scenario:**  
A DAO automates monthly payroll for contributors, but only if they have completed a minimum number of onchain actions (e.g., governance votes, contract interactions). Each payment is logged, and contributors receive an NFT “Pay Stub” as proof.

**Workflow:**

1. **Schedule Block**
   - Triggers the workflow monthly.
2. **Onchain Data Fetch Block**
   - Fetches each contributor’s onchain activity (votes, contract calls) for the past month.
3. **Condition Block**
   - Checks if the contributor meets the minimum activity threshold.
4. **Payment Block**
   - Sends SEI tokens to eligible contributors.
5. **NFT Block (Mint)**
   - Mints a “Pay Stub” NFT to each paid contributor.
6. **Notification Block**
   - Notifies contributors via email/Discord about their payment and NFT.
7. **HTTP Request Block**
   - Logs payroll and compliance data to an external HR system.
8. **Custom Block**
   - Optionally, runs custom compliance logic or generates a payroll report.

## **Use Case 3: Real-Time NFT Marketplace Alert & Automated Purchase**

**Scenario:**  
A collector wants to automatically buy rare NFTs as soon as they are listed below a certain price, and receive instant notifications and a summary report.

**Workflow:**

1. **Sei Wallet Listener Block**
   - Monitors NFT marketplace contracts for new listings.
2. **Onchain Data Fetch Block**
   - Fetches NFT metadata and listing price.
3. **Condition Block**
   - Checks if the NFT matches the collector’s criteria (e.g., rarity, price < 500 SEI).
4. **Sei Smart Contract Call Block**
   - Executes a purchase transaction for the NFT.
5. **NFT Block (Transfer/Monitor)**
   - Confirms the NFT was received in the collector’s wallet.
6. **Notification Block**
   - Sends a Telegram/Discord alert and an email with NFT details.
7. **Data Transform Block**
   - Formats the summary report.
8. **HTTP Request Block**
   - Posts the purchase event to a portfolio tracking API.

- **Notification Block:** For multi-channel user alerts.
- **HTTP Request Block:** For external integrations/logging.
- **Schedule Block:** For recurring workflows (e.g., payroll).
- **Data Transform Block:** For formatting and preparing data for notifications or APIs.
- **Custom Block:** For any custom logic or reporting.
