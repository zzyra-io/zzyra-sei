User Experience Considerations
The AI block generation process is designed with UX in mind:

Progressive Disclosure:
Simple interface for basic blocks
Advanced options for complex logic
AI handles complexity behind the scenes
Iterative Refinement:
Users can edit AI-generated blocks
They can provide feedback to improve generation
Blocks can be versioned and improved over time
Error Prevention:
The system guides users toward valid configurations
Common errors are caught early
Helpful suggestions improve block quality
Production-Ready Aspects
Your focus on production readiness is addressed through:

Performance Optimization:
AI generation requests are queued and managed
Caching reduces duplicate generation
Pre-generated templates speed up creation
Scalability:
The system handles multiple concurrent generation requests
Block library scales with growing user base
Database indexes optimize block retrieval
Reliability:
Fallback mechanisms if AI generation fails
Graceful degradation options
Comprehensive error handling
