## Complete User Stories

### US-001: AI-Generated DeFi Workflow

**Epic**: AI Workflow Generation  
**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Assignee**: TBD  
**Sprint**: TBD

#### User Story

```
As a non-technical DeFi investor
I want to describe my investment strategy in plain English and have AI generate a complete workflow
So that I can automate complex DeFi strategies without learning the technical details
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1: Natural Language Input**

```
Given I'm on the workflow builder page
When I click "Generate with AI" and enter "Monitor Ethereum gas prices and stake my ETH when gas is below 15 gwei"
Then the AI should parse my intent and identify the required blocks:
- Gas price monitor trigger
- Condition block for <15 gwei threshold
- ETH staking action block
- Notification block for confirmation
```

**AC2: Workflow Generation**

```
Given the AI has parsed my strategy
When it generates the workflow
Then it should:
- Create a visual workflow with properly connected blocks
- Pre-configure block parameters based on my description
- Set reasonable default values (e.g., check frequency, notification preferences)
- Include error handling and safety checks
```

**AC3: User Review and Customization**

```
Given the AI has generated a workflow
When I review it in the builder
Then I should be able to:
- See explanations for each block's purpose
- Modify parameters through a guided interface
- Add/remove blocks with AI suggestions
- Preview the workflow execution logic
```

**AC4: Validation and Testing**

```
Given I've customized the generated workflow
When I attempt to save and activate it
Then the system should:
- Validate all block configurations
- Check wallet permissions and balances
- Run a dry-run simulation

### US-002: Cross-Protocol Yield Optimization

**Epic**: DeFi Portfolio Management  
**Priority**: High (P1)  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Assignee**: TBD  
**Sprint**: TBD

#### User Story

```
As a yield farmer with positions across multiple protocols
I want my portfolio to automatically move funds to the highest-yielding opportunities
So that I can maximize returns without constantly monitoring rates across protocols
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1: Multi-Protocol Monitoring**

```
Given I have enabled yield monitoring for Aave, Compound, Yearn, and Convex
When the system checks yield rates (every 15 minutes)
Then it should:
- Fetch current APY/APR for my asset types (USDC, DAI, ETH)
- Account for protocol fees and token rewards
- Calculate net yield after gas costs
- Store historical data for trend analysis
```

**AC2: Opportunity Detection**

```
Given yield rates have been updated
When a better opportunity is found (>2% improvement for >$500)
When opportunity has persisted for >30 minutes (avoid MEV/temporary spikes)
Then the system should:
- Queue a rebalancing proposal
- Calculate optimal allocation percentages
- Estimate total gas costs for the operation
- Verify protocol health scores and TVL
```

**AC3: Automated Execution**

```
Given a rebalancing opportunity is approved
When the workflow executes
Then it should:
- Withdraw from lower-yield positions (respecting cooldown periods)
- Execute swaps if different tokens are needed
- Deposit to higher-yield protocols in a single transaction where possible
- Update position tracking and portfolio dashboard
- Complete within 10 minutes or timeout with notification
```

**AC4: Risk Management**

```
Given any step in the rebalancing process
When risk thresholds are checked
Then the system should halt if:
- Gas price exceeds 100 gwei
- Protocol TVL has dropped >20% in 24 hours
- Slippage would exceed 1%
- Available liquidity is insufficient
- Protocol smart contracts are paused
```

**AC5: Reporting and Notifications**

```
Given a rebalancing has completed or failed
When the final state is determined
Then the user should receive:
- Real-time dashboard update with new positions
- Email summary with before/after yields and transaction links
- Discord notification if part of a trading group
- Weekly performance report comparing to HODL strategy
```

### US-003: Liquidation Protection System

**Epic**: Risk Management  
**Priority**: Critical (P0)  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Assignee**: TBD  
**Sprint**: TBD

#### User Story

```
As a DeFi borrower with collateralized positions
I want automatic protection against liquidation across all my lending positions
So that I never lose my collateral due to price movements or missed monitoring
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

**AC1: Position Monitoring**

```
Given I have connected wallets with active lending positions
When the system monitors my positions (every 30 seconds)
Then it should:
- Track collateral ratios across Aave, Compound, MakerDAO
- Monitor collateral token prices from multiple oracles
- Calculate liquidation risk scores and time-to-liquidation
- Account for gas costs in protection calculations
```

**AC2: Early Warning System**

```
Given my collateral ratio approaches danger levels
When ratio drops to 170% (configurable, default varies by protocol)
Then the system should:
- Send immediate SMS and email alerts
- Display urgent notifications in the dashboard
- Prepare automated protection transactions
- Suggest manual intervention options
```

**AC3: Automated Protection**

```
Given my collateral ratio hits 160% (critical threshold)
When automated protection is enabled
Then the system should execute in order of preference:
1. Repay portion of debt using available wallet balance
2. Add more collateral if I have approved tokens
3. Partially close position if neither option 1 or 2 viable
4. Emergency liquidation if all else fails (better than total loss)
```

**AC4: Multi-Chain Coordination**

```
Given I have positions across Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum
When protection is needed on any chain
Then the system should:
- Prioritize using funds available on the same chain
- Bridge funds from other chains if necessary and time permits
- Execute cross-chain protection within 5 minutes
- Update all position tracking across chains
```

**AC5: Recovery and Reporting**

```
Given protection actions have been executed
When the dust settles
Then the system should:
- Verify all positions are safe (>200% collateral ratio)
- Generate detailed incident report with timeline
- Calculate protection costs vs liquidation penalty saved
- Recommend position size adjustments to prevent future incidents
```
